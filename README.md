# Simon-Says Game - README

Flashing Button Game is a simple web-based memory game where the player repeats a sequence of flashing buttons to advance through levels. The game challenges memory and reflexes by requiring players to follow increasingly complex sequences. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a fully interactive experience.

# Features
- **Start Game**: Begin the game by pressing the "Start Game" button.
- **Button Flashing**: Buttons flash in a sequence that the player must repeat.
- **Game Progression**: The sequence grows longer with each level.
- **Game Over**: If the user fails to repeat the sequence correctly, the game ends.
- **High Score**: Tracks and displays the highest score achieved.

# Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout for a clean, responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and interactivity, including button flashes and sequence checking.

## How It Works
### Game Flow:
1. **Start Game**: The player presses the "Start Game" button to begin.
2. **Level Progression**: A sequence of buttons flashes. The player repeats the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.
3. **Game Over**: If the player presses the wrong button, the game ends and a "Game Over" message is shown. The game can be restarted by pressing any key.

### Sequence Generation:
- The sequence is generated randomly by selecting one button at a time.
- As the game progresses, the length of the sequence increases.

### User Interaction:
- The user clicks on the colored buttons in the same order they flash.
- Visual feedback is provided by flashing the buttons when the user clicks them or when the game sequence is shown.
